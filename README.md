# Torben's Bookshelf (iOS-App)

## About

An App for Remembering which books you have at home by simply saying it to you! Just scan the Code on the back of the book and know if you have it! Furthermore, adding books you have been never easier thanks to the [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org). More benefits are also that the App knows everything about your book and also about your author, so you might find information you did not know before!

## Architecture Overview

This app is built with Swift, using The Composable Architecture (TCA) by [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co). An interesting fact about the app is also that the different logic and UI parts of the app have been separated for better development.
